# Introduction and Goals

## Quality Goals
| Quality-Goal | Motivation and Explanation |
|-|-|
| Modifiability | Since this is a side project, it's crucial that changes, such as publishing a new blog post, can be made quickly and easily. |
| Analysability | The system should be easy to understand and well-structured so that others, or my future self, can quickly grasp how it works. This supports learning, knowledge sharing, and smooth onboarding, and helps make the project a reference for educational or personal growth purposes. |
| Simplicity | The system should avoid unnecessary complexity, both in user experience and implementation. This makes development and future changes easier. |
| Performance Efficiency | The site should load quickly and remain responsive, even with media-heavy posts or under moderate traffic. |
